# Gameplay Guide
If you've installed Slidikins' Strenuous Skyrim, chances are you've just added hundreds of mods without the opportunity to read each one's description thoroughly. To save you some time and to help you get adjusted, I'll try to boil down the essentials of what you need to know going into the game.

## 1. Reduced HUD
The first thing you'll probably notice when you take control of the Prisoner is a lack of on-screen information. By default, the only HUD element that is always displayed is your Health Bar (and attached Shout Meter). Stamina and Magicka Bars appear whenever they are not filled, and the Crosshair will only appear when equipping a ranged weapon or spell.

Enemy information is completely hidden from you as the player. You'll no longer be able to see the remaining health of an enemy or their level. You won't even be able to see a foe's name in most situations. Keep that in mind as **some enemies may be quite strong compared to those around them**. Proceed with caution and always have a backup plan in case you find yourself outmatched.

Lastly, activation prompts have been removed. Most of the time the UI will give no indication you're about to steal an item. (Stealth indicators are also removed so it's up to you to determine if you're hidden or not.) Locked containers and doors won't broadcast their difficulty either; you'll need to try your hand at it and decide for yourself if it's worth the lockpicks.

> **Tip:** If you do get caught committing crimes (shame on you!), don't reload! Getting caught is part of the criminal's journey and can enhance your roleplay experience. Skipping town for awhile will gradually lower your bounty thanks to [Wergild Depreciation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11452). A silver tongue will also help you with the occassional bribe.

In general, expect the game to tell you far less information, leaving you to infer a lot of it on your own.

## 2. Survival and Exploration
This list expects you to enable [Survival Mode](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Survival_Mode) when prompted at the end of the tutorial sequence and to deal with its mechanics, specifically *eating*, *sleeping*, and *keeping warm*.

### Hunger
Fuel for your adventurer, food will be a near-constant concern on your journey. Neglecting to eat will lower your maximum Stamina, slow your Magicka recovery, and eventually affect your physical prowess. Luckily, food is somewhat abundant in Skyrim if you know where to look.

- Fruits and vegetables are commonly found in barrels all around the region.  
- Hunt wild animals for meat if you prefer protein in your diet, or utilize [Fishing](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Fishing) to source from the rivers of Skyrim.  
- With a dash of Salt Pile, you can cook the above into more filling meals that give larger regeneration bonuses.  
- Different types of foods given different bonuses, each lasting 30 real time minutes. A varied diet can have a profound effect on your dungeon crawling.
- If you have a heavy coin pouch, you can simply buy ingredients or fully cooked meals from vendors to save yourself time.

### Fatigue
Soon after being left to your own devices you will find yourself being Lethargic or Tired and in need of sleep. Several options are available to you, though you may want to act fast before the penalties to your maximum Magicka and Stamina recovery make it harder to fight effectively. Your experience rate will also drop when you are fatigued, and improve when you're rested.

- A multitude of bedrolls are scattered around Skyrim. You won't wake up Well Rested, but it's free.  
- Sleeping in town is another option. However, the cost of an inn depends on the location and there's a 33% chance each night that the rooms are all booked up.  
- Of course, you can always take what you want from the local brigands. Bandit camps typically have a warm, indoor bed to enjoy once the owners have been dealt with.  
- Eventually you'll want to purchase an official residence for something dependable and reliable.

### Cold
Skyrim is a cold, northern environment and ignoring the elements will lead to your downfall. Your Health is directly at risk when dealing with the cold, but there are ways of dealing with it.

- Avoid the obvious. Snowstorms clearly mean freezing temperatures, as are lakes and rivers in snowy regions. Stay out of them.  
- Purchasing or cooking hot soups and stews can warm you up as needed along your travels.  
- Wearing clothes with a lot of coverage and/or fur will leave you warmer than other options. Conversely, metal armor is more susceptible to lower temperature. Heavy armor users may want to carry a change of clothes for the road.
- The winter months will naturally be colder than the rest of the year. Factor that into your travelling preparations.

### Other Notes
- Your Health won't regenerate on its own. You'll need to utilize other sources of regeneration to recover, such as food, potions, perks, or Restoration magic.  
- Containers are no longer bottomless. If you want to hoard goods and materials you'll need to find a suitable location with enough chests for your stash.  
- Similarly, your Carry Weight has been reduced, encouraging you to reconsider what's worth leaving the house with as well as what's worth picking up in a dungeon.  
- Imperial Septims can't be found in places where it wouldn't make sense. You'll find foreign currency in their place instead. Picking these up will auto-convert to Septims at various exchange rates thanks to [C.O.I.N.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51439)

## 3. Crafting
The hard limit on player level (Lv50) and perk points (55 total) makes it harder to invest in multiple crafting skills while at the same time makes it more worthwhile to utilize them all. As you make your mark on Skyrim, don't be afraid to pour some of your earnings into the crafted goods you can not create yourself. For stuff you create, note that the formula for the experience gained has been adjusted with [Crafting Skill Leveling Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21727). You'll no longer want to craft thousands of Iron Daggers but instead focus on valuable jewelry and higher tier equipment.

### Alchemy
Alchemical goods can be found in almost every settlement at the general store if not a dedicated alchemy store. Many of the available potion effects last for a minute or longer and provide percentage-based buffs making them viable at all levels of play. Additionally you can craft your own alchemy potions and poisons, combining useful effects to save on Carry Weight. Even without perk investment it's worth your while to dabble in Alchemy for this reason. Ingredients can be found everywhere so there's nothing to lose!

### Smithing
With the exception of the quintessential Mage, most adventurers will have some reason to look towards Smithing. Higher tier weapons and armor have been removed from the random loot lists so your options for obtaining them are limited to hunting very specific enemies, crafting them yourself or commissioning the work from a Blacksmith. These same weapons and armor will degrade with use and require tempering to maintain their quality ([Item Durability](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42544)). A master at the craft can add +10 to the base damage/armor of equipment with a single ingot. If you're not up to the task, you can and should pay a Blacksmith to do it for you.

### Enchanting
Enchanting will give you the extra oomph you need to go from good to great, no matter your playstyle. Novice enchanters can add noticeable boosts to their gear but it's a long investment before one can get rival the skill of an Adept or Expert enchanter. Until then, feel free to pay them for their work. The price tag can be daunting but the benefits of a well picked enchantment is priceless in the long term.

## 4. Combat
Removing combat related HUD elements already increases difficulty but keep in mind there are additional changes to combat under the hood. For starters, you'll be more vulnerable when on the offensive, such as power attacking, drawing a bow, or casting a spell. A poorly timed attack could send you to an early grave so pick your spots carefully.

> **Tip:** Even though health bars were removed, [Just Blood](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46501) will add increasing bloody overlays on enemies as a rough indicator of their Health. Keep an eye out for this subtle effect.

On top of that, enemies have been placed into tiers and you'll want to build your strength up before tackling some of them. For example, Falmer and Dwemer ruins are best avoided until Lv20 or so, and Daedra until Lv30. Of course, this is just a general rule, but keep that in mind if you run into a figurative wall on your adventures. Dragons in particular are much tougher than they are in the vanilla game, with their levels soaring far higher than your Lv50 cap. But you're Dovahkiin, you'll figure it out. Learning and paying attention to the [Resistances and Weaknesses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45253) of an enemy will be a huge boon in your favor when tackling challenging creatures.

### Followers
It sounds like the deck is stacked against you, and in many ways it is. But you don't have to go it alone. Keep in mind the following changes when bringing a follower along:
- NPCs, including followers, use ammo the same as you. If your follower uses a bow, make sure to keep them supplied with arrows.
- Followers who run out of Health will be in a "downed" state for 2 minutes unless healed by Restoration magic. Enemies will ignore them in this state. ([STAYDOWN](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41228))  
- Followers are Hidden whenever you attempt to sneak and will no longer ruin your element of surprise.  
- Mercenaries will charge more for their services based on factors such as their level. ([Dynamic Mercenary Fees](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45677))

#### Relevant Control Changes
- **Lock On:** `Middle Mouse Button`  
- **Cycle Targets:** `Mouse Scroll Wheel Up/Down`

> Locking on is a convenient way to keep an enemy centered on your screen in first-person or third-person perspective. It's a completely optional mechanic and offers no tangible advantage otherwise.

## Tips & Tricks
As you can probably infer from the name of this addon, your adventure in Skyrim will have its difficult moments. Here are some tips that I’ve found useful for making the journey in one piece.

### Early Game (Level 1 - 10)

#### Take it Easy and Start Small
You’ve just escaped Helgen by the skin of your teeth. You don’t have much to your name, and you don’t have nifty perks that deliver the pain to your enemies. Take a moment to collect yourself in town. Craft a bit and make a little money to get yourself started. The Skyrim Uncapper is configured to give less character exp for your crafting skills, so there’s no need to worry about overleveling yourself out of the gate. There will be plenty of time to delve into dungeons later. Make sure you’re properly equipped now.

#### Stay in Range of Whiterun
The urge to explore is strong but try to fight it off in the early game. There is plenty to do in Whiterun Hold once you’ve reached Riverwood, and that content should get you to Level 10 without too many hitches. A [Missives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576) board can be found in Whiterun if you need additional tasks. Bleak Falls Barrow can be handled easily by Level 5, though you may want to wait until you’re closer to Level 10 before tackling Dragon Rising. Also, buy Breezehome. All of the other homes are more expensive and you’ll need someplace reliable to store your valuables until you come into money.

### Mid Game (Level 10 - 30)

#### Buy a Horse (or Two!)
Forget what I just said about staying local. It’s time to explore and get into the thick of it! Time passes fast on the overworld, however, so unless you want to spend all of daylight traveling from Point A to Point B, invest in a horse to shorten your travel times. And if you’re really going far I recommend making use of the carriages from time to time. Since your carry weight (and that of your follower) is halved, horses are also the best way to move a lot of supplies from one place to another. (Remember to crouch to access horse storage!)

#### Join a Faction
Go find yourself a faction (e.g. The Companions) that suits your character and sign up. Their quests will support the skills you’re looking to improve. As you progress through the tier, consider signing up for the Stormcloaks or the Imperial Legion if you have a stake in the civil war. Their quests are less focused, but they’ll provide plenty of targets to practice on to level up further.

### Late Game (Level 30 - 50)

#### Utilize Crafting
Seriously, I can’t stress this enough. In the late game you may be dealing with areas that are scaled high above your Level 50 limit, some at that point long before you reach the cap. You’ll need every advantage you can get to bridge the gap, and most of those advantages are obtained through crafting. If you ignored this early on, now’s a good time to reconsider it. If on Master or Legendary difficulty, it might be time to make different equipment sets for different types of enemies, even.
