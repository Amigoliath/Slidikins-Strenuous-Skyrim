## 2021-08-20 (4.7.2.1)
This update moves the entire guide to [GitHub](https://github.com/Amigoliath/Slidikins-Strenuous-Skyrim) first and foremost. When I first started documenting my modlist back in 2014 it was simply a list of mods I used for a friend of mine to reference. Now that it's most definitely become something larger, I felt the need to move to a format with more documentation. I've also uploaded the list to Wabbajack in 4.7.2.1. It isn't listed in the gallery, but the `.wabbajack` file will be made available to download for installing from disk.

## 2021-08-16 (4.7.1)
A lot of things in the document will look different for this update. For starters, I’ve mimicked TPF’s format with regards to linking straight to the download page and instructions. This removes author credits and explanations but it’ll be more consistent for TPF users. I’ve also removed my Main Menu edits, as it’s just easier to stay in step with the main guide on that. All of my personal files have been uploaded to the Nexus as well, so that page will become the hub for file updates. This will allow me to throw the list up on Wabbajack later on. There are also a few changes to what’s listed as optional and what isn’t, just to be simpler on my end.

## 2021-08-03
It’s been a week since the last update and I’ve gotten a nice amount of playtime in to feel things out. Minor additions in this update involve a few missing patches and changes for consistency. Major changes include adding Rare Curios back in as well as the hot True Directional Movement. For this update you’ll have to repair Honed Metal via its MCM, and you’ll also need to re-run Nemesis for TDM. A side effect I’ve noticed from TDM is that auto-run can’t be disabled by hitting back. You’ll have to hit the button again to turn it off.
- **Interface:** SmoothCam updated to 1.4.1
- **Interface:** Added True Directional Movement - Modernized Third Person Gameplay
- **Interface:** Added Nordic UI - Flashing Savegames Patch
- **Gameplay Overhauls:** Apothecary - An Alchemy Overhaul updated to 1.1.1
- **New Content:** Added Rare Curios (CC) back as a completely optional addon
- **New Content:** Added The Phoenix Flavour - Rare Curios Patch
- **New Content:** Added Apothecary - Rare Curios Patch
- **Skeleton & Animations:** Draw 2 - Dual Weapon Equip-Unequip Animations updated to 1.5
- **Conflict Resolution:** Perks ‘Unstoppable’ and ‘Unhindered’ added to potential followers, allowing them to carry some extra gear with the recent change
- **Conflict Resolution:** Lowered HorseRace carry weight from 999 to 480
- **Conflict Resolution:** Hid two dialogue options from Sergius Turrianus since you can, in fact, have him enchant items for you
- **Conflict Resolution:** Incorporated lilebonymace’s Adamant - Honed Metal Updated Patch
- **Configuration:** Added instructions for Alchemy Adjustments, adjusting the exp multiplier to X1.0
- **Configuration:** Changed Honed Metal’s Crafting Cost Modifier to 0.6
- **Configuration:** Instructions added for True Directional Movement - Modernized Third Person Gameplay

## 2021-07-25
Another update independent of TPF’s changes. Most of these are minor tweaks that I deemed necessary while playing through on my current character, so let’s just address the biggest change: Apothecary. Simon Magus and DeltaRider have released this much-anticipated mod, and it works beautifully in TPF. However, I personally did not like the implementation of the Food and Drink Addon (in comparison to Alchemy Potions and Food Adjustments) and chose to keep food unchanged. That said, Apothecary does a fantastic job of overwriting everything it needs and nothing more, so we’re able to keep both in the load order with minimal conflict.
- **Fixes:** Added additional instructions for powerofthree’s Tweaks
- **Weather:** Moved Splashes of Skyrim to Visual FX and updated to 1.2.1
- **Visual FX:** Just Blood - Dirt and Blood Lite updated to 1.1
- **Gameplay Overhauls:** Honed Metal officially updated to 1.21, fixing the earlier issues
- **Gameplay Overhauls:** Removed Alchemy Adjustments - TPF Tweaks
- **Gameplay Overhauls:** Added note to hide or delete AlchemyAdjustments - WACCF Patch.esp from Alchemy Potions and Food Adjustments
- **Gameplay Overhauls:** Added Apothecary - An Alchemy Overhaul
- **Miscellaneous:** C.O.I.N. - Coins of Interesting Natures updated to 1.1.6
- **Assorted Plugins:** Removed SSE Gameplay Tweaks’ edit on Line 148
- **Assorted Plugins:** Added Don’t Stay in the Water
- **Skeleton & Animations:** Added note to EVG Animation Variance for preventing crashes with the female skeleton
- **Conflict Resolution:** Made a handful of changes where Apothecary - An Alchemy Overhaul was still losing conflicts
- **Conflict Resolution:** Added two small changes to load screens to account for changes made to the UI and Uncapper
- **Conflict Resolution:** Added numerous changes to certain Carry Weight buffs to remain consistent with Survival’s design
- **Conflict Resolution:** Added SPID file to halve carry weight for followers as well if Survival is enabled
- **Conflict Resolution:** Added attack speed fix tweak to Dual Flurry (xxB5FC0B) as TPF’s CRP does not include it
- **Configuration:** Added instructions for Favorite Howls Menu as the options do not show up otherwise if you’re a werewolf
- **Configuration:** Honed Metal’s Tempering Cost Modifier changed to 0.04
- **Configuration:** Removed instructions for Wonders of Weather

## 2021-07-06 (4.6.2)
Ugh. So, right after switching back to Honed Metal SSE the host hid the file and encouraged everyone to use Honed Metal Updated. So it’s back. On the upside, I’ve been unable to replicate the bug that I was experiencing the day before (for reasons unknown) so maybe things will be alright this time around. Temper prices are currently not working properly, but I’m working with the author to find the problem and fix it. Until then, I recommend avoiding the temper service completely.

I’ve also added Nordic UI for a change of pace. It is completely optional, but if you choose to use it keep in mind that the guide is written for my particular installation instructions, which are noted in the Interface section.
- Updated for [TPF 4.6.2](https://thephoenixflavour.com/tpf/appendix/changelog/#release-462)

- **Interface:** Added Nordic UI
- **Interface:** Added Forget Spell
- **Gameplay Overhauls:** Honed Metal switched to Honed Metal Updated… again
- **Gameplay Overhauls:** Honed Metal Voiced updated to 1.5 (for Honed Metal Updated)... again
- **Conflict Resolution:** Added Adamant’s Flesh spell effects to the Glow Be Gone-esque changes
- **Configuration:** Removed All Geared Up instructions as I no longer use the TPF-X addon that adds it
- **Configuration:** Removed Immersive HUD’s crosshair activation changes
- **Configuration:** Removed SkyUI’s Disable Item Colors change
- **Gameplay Tips:** Added section that no one asked for

## 2021-07-02
It was brought to my attention that Honed Metal Updated was quite expensive and that took me down a rabbit hole which resulted in me getting rid of that update altogether. If you’re using Honed Metal Updated, uninstall it via its MCM, then save and disable the plugins. Load the save and save again. Finally, switch back to Honed Metal v1.10 and apply the MCM changes so that tempering costs are realistic.
- **Gameplay Overhauls:** Honed Metal Updated switched back to Honed Metal
- **Miscellaneous:** C.O.I.N. - Coins of Interesting Natures updated to 1.1.5.1
- **Configuration:** Added instructions for Honed Metal’s MCM
- **Configuration:** Added “Hide shout meter with compass” instruction to Immersive HUD’s MCM

## 2021-07-01
Following TPF’s changes to 4.6 I had to drop a few economy-related mods from the list. This update is an attempt to bring some of those changes back albeit in a slightly different fashion. Adamant - Plus Ten Smithing lowers the potential of tempering, limiting it to adding +10 to an item’s base damage or armor value. While the mod intends to have this show up as +1 through +10 beside the item name, it is not entirely accurate when paired with Item Durability. As such, I’m leaving the upgrade tier names as is, giving the player a vague idea of the health of the item.
- **Gameplay Overhauls:** Added Adamant - Plus Ten Smithing
- **Combat & Encounters:** Container and Arrow Weight Restrictions properly moved to Miscellaneous
- **Combat & Encounters:** Section moved above New Content to match TPF
